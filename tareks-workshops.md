<h2><span>Workshop 1: Programming</span></h2>
<p class="cols">
So the aim of those sessions and workshops that I would like to provides is to teach people about programming. People won’t eventually come out as Web developers or professional python coders, it’s rather more about providing a core or a foundation in programming and problem solving which is in my opinion an absolute requirement for a person to call himself a programmer, and not just a Python coder, or a Ruby coder. By understanding the idea behind programming and its basics first, it opens the doors for a person to dig into whatever language or framework all by themselves later on, and gives them the ability to decide on what they learn, and why the chose that.
<br>
<br>
So this is intended for absolute beginners who would like to learn about programming. I will begin the workshops with pure basic intro to programming, problem solving, definition of algorithms, and describing pseudo code. Pseudo code will be used to provide the basics of a real programming language, but in simple English text. That could be assigning variables, conditionals, loops and others. And then attendees will practice a bit solving problems using pseudo code. This should be for the first session.
<br>
<br>
Later on in next sessions we’ll take that to the next level, which is writing real applications using Java, focusing on real formal programming syntax, datatypes, compilation and running..etc
</p>
<p>
I will give out a more clear outline during the first session, perhaps also to see how well accepted it is or if changes to be made.

<h2><span>Workshop 2: Web Development</span></h2>

<p class="cols">
These are sessions I would also like to hold for people who are interested in Web Development. I used to carry out similar workshops last year, so I still have the outline which wouldn’t be much different, you can check it out here: http://sessions.tgalal.com/ . Absolute beginners are also welcome to these sessions but, most probably I will not go into Javascript or any server-side programming (which is not necessarily PHP) unless students do know programming basics, whether as a previous knowledge or from attending the programming workshop.
