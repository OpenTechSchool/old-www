##About Mailing lists (aka Google Groups)

Mailing lists is our chosen way to stay on top of the communication in the areas we like to be active in. That’s why we set up a number of lists as Google Groups to make it possible for everyone to be up to date but also don’t get “spammed” by stuff that doesn’t matter to them.


## List of existing lists

To find all lists please go to our [Google Groups index page](https://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forumsearch).

{% include groups_list.md %}



> **Note**: Please note that some groups are not visible to you if you don't have an <span style="color: #085987;">@opentechschool.org</span> account or you can't post to them if you are not a member. To become a member is easy, just come by at one of our team breakfasts or write an email to <span style="color: #085987;">Team Tech</span>.

## Guidelines

Team Tech decided to install some conventions to make it easier to create new groups and understand their purpose. As this is an open process we invite everyone to suggest optimizations.


Mailinglists should:

* be/stay opt in, i.e. join if you want to be part of a that group 

* follow a name pattern to easily grasp their use, suggestion:

   * team.berlin@ots -> all people active in this city (e.g. team.stockholm etc)
   * team.tech, team.communications, team.blueprint -> teams with a specific focus
   * discuss.berlin, discuss.global -> replacement for the opentechschool@googlegroups.com
   * coaches.python, coaches.js, coaches.math-3d -> for coaches mailing-lists
   * public facing mailing-lists such as offers@ots (or later on press@ots) -> for external people to post offers/requests to the members of OTS.   
These mailing-lists are for @ots members only who will filter, curate and/or act on the emails (by posting/pushing the interesting offers on a designated webpage for instance, or getting in touch with the journalists, etc.)
   * When the non-prefix part of the mailing-list is two words or more (e.g. math-3d, online-courses, etc.) use "-" to separate the words

* always have a comprehensible subject prefix:

   * \[OTS-Secondword\] in all cases:

      * OTS in all caps,
      * dash
      * Secondword is upper case and is the second word in the mailing-list name (or only word in the case of the public facing mailing-list) -> e.g. Berlin for team.berlin, Tech for team.tech, Python for coaches.python, Math-3d for coaches.math-3d, Offers for offers
      * If Secondword is actually several words (e.g. math-3d, online-courses, etc.) use "-" to seperate the words and lower case for all words except the first one -> [OTS-Math-3d], [OTS-Online-courses], etc.
      * Only exception is for discuss: then use [OpenTechSchool-Berlin], [OpenTechSchool-Global] etc. -> as some people might sign up and not know/remember what OTS means and to avoid confusion with team.berlin (which is [OTS-Berlin])

* membership/post/viewable:

   * team.* :

      * membership = only \*@ots for easier management (docs get shared automatically etc.)
      * post = team decision if external mails can get in or limited to members (before this decision is made, default should be set to members and \*@ots only)
      * viewable = team decision if content should be publicly viewable (before this decision is made, default should be set to members and *@ots only)

   * discuss.* :

      * membership = anyone  (note: that means the "Allow new users not in opentechschool.org" setting needs to be activated and "Join the Group" should be set to "Anyone" -> both can be found in Settings/New members)
      * post = members of the group
      * viewable = public

   * coaches.* :

      * membership = anyone  (note: that means the "Allow new users not in opentechschool.org" setting needs to be activated and "Join the Group" should be set to "Anyone" -> both can be found in Settings/New members)
      * post = members of the group
      * viewable = public

   * public facing mailing-lists (e.g. offers, press etc.)

      * membership = only \*@ots
      * post = anyone
      * viewable = only \*@ots

* all mailing-lists where some members do not have @ots addresses (i.e. non-team mailing-list) should contain an email footer with:
   * Display how to post to this group by email
   * Display how to unsubscribe from this group by email

* Group's primary language is decided by each team or group of coaches.   
For public facing mailing-lists and  discuss mailing-lists and by default before the teams make any decision the language is set to English (United States)
